                              4.EXIT
  IF WE CHOOSE OPTION 4 : IT WILL APPEND DATA MEANS IT WRITE IN TEXT FILE JOINING TO OLD WRITEUP

  TASK 2: BUILD A TOOL TO COMPRESS AND DECOMPRESS FILES USING MULTITHREADING FOR PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION.
  FIRST WRITE CODE AND RUN THE CODE.
  CHOOSE OPTION 1(COMPRESS) AND 2(DECOMPRESS) :
  IF WE CHOOSE 1 : AABBCCDD
  THE COMPRESS OUTPUT WIIL BE : 2A2B2C2D
  IF WE CHOOSE 2 : 2A2B2C2D
  THE DECOMPRESS OUTPUT WILL BE : AABBCCDD

  TASK 3: CREATE A SNAKE GAME USING LIBRARIES LIKE SFML OR SDL.
